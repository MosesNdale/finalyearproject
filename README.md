This is my website I have made which was about the personalised transport planner that uses python, jupyter notebook and flask. It is free to use. The personalised transport planner provides live transport updates and the ability to personalise information for improvement access and innovation to help travellers use a public transport efficiently and this will encourage people to choose this planner that was created on a website as a method of travel when planning a journey that cost free including the information to be read from the TFL's API, as well as the London Air API, in JSON for transport applications to be made by developers on their own or if people would want to understand the code behind the personalised transport planner.
