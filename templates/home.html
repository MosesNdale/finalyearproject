<!-- This section covers the research based on the background of the TFL transport API and its role in London -->   
<p style="border: 2px solid black; background-color:white;"><strong><u>Background of TFL transport API and its role in London</u></strong><br>History of TFL: TFL stands for transport for london and it was founded on the 3rd of July 2000 in England, TFL is a local government body that is responsible for London's transport system.<br> The unification of the TFL transport API brings together data across all modes of transport into a single RESTful API, which is found <a href="https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/api-details#api=ReleasedUnifiedAPIProd">here</a>. This TFL transport API provides access to the most highly requested realtime and status information across all the modes of transport, in a single and consistent way. TFL's role is to implement the Mayor's transport strategy and manage transport services across the capital in London, for which the Mayor has responsibility to plan this. TFL is directed by a management board whose members are chosen for their understanding of transport matters and appointed by the Mayor of London. TFL's Commissioner and the chief officers are responsible and accountable for the day-to-day operations of the organisation. TFL manages London's buses, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, London Overground and London Trams. It also runs London River Services, Victoria Coach Station and the congestion charge scheme. TFL also has responsibility for a network of main roads, including over London's 6,000 traffic lights and regulates taxis and the private hire trade.
